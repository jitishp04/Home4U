# Home4U - Group 16
## Description
HOME4U is a smart home system that provides users with the experience of monitoring home security from a distance and enjoying smart control of their home through devices. This involves:
- Set security mode from Wio terminal and app
- Turn off alarm through app and Wio terminal
- Interact (play, pause, skip) songs via app and Wio terminal 
- Create scenes (though unable to execute, open to development)

## Setup and Get Started
### Material
Hardware requirement:
- Wio terminal
- Grove - Speaker
- Grove - Mini PIR Motion Sensor
- Android phone
- Laptop or computer

### Setup
![Wio Terminal Setup](README-images/WioTerminalSetupImage.jpg)*Speaker (left), mini PIR motion sensor (right) connected to Wio terminal*

The following image above shows the setup for the Wio terminal to your computer using an USB-C port. Make sure the speaker is connected to the left side and motion sensor to the right side unless code has been altered.

### Automated Build
**For the android application:**
```
cd android && ./gradlew build
```
**For Wio Terminal:**
```
docker build -t wio_terminal_imageÂ ./wio_terminal
```
*This will build the app inside a Docker image. To extract the built file, also run:*
```
docker run --name wio_terminal_container wio_terminal_image
docker cp wio_terminal_container:wio_terminal/build/wio_terminal.ino.bin .
docker stop wio_terminal_container
docker rm wio_terminal_container
```
